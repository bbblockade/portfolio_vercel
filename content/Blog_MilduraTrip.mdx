As part of my internship with **Agriculture Victoria**, I joined a **three-day field trip** to the **Smart Farm in Mildura**. The main goal was to present our beehive monitoring dashboard and meet the beekeepers who use the data in practice.

### 🐝 Presenting to Beekeepers

We introduced the dashboard, which displays hive-level data and flags abnormal behaviour based on sensor and sound readings, as well as chemical spray records.

We gave a walkthrough of how the system works and gathered feedback from local beekeepers.

### 🧰 Field Work

We also assisted with fixing a blocked irrigation pipe by manually adjusting valves across the site.

Later, we drove around the farm in a buggy to observe the sensor locations and overall layout, which helped connect the data we had been working with to the real environment. This was fun.

### 🌅 Murray River Walk

After work, we had a chance to walk along the **Murray River** before sunset. The walk was quiet and a good way to wind down after the day's tasks.

### 🍽️ Dinner at The Spanish Grill

On the first night, we had dinner at **The Spanish Grill steakhouse** in Mildura. The food was great, and it was a nice way to end the day.
